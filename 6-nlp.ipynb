    "- Shannon, in \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\" (1948), famoulsy defines communication as selection:\n",
    "> \"The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design.\"\n",
    "- We can model such systems - including a natural language like English - with Markov chains:\n",
    "> \"We can also approximate to a natural language by means of a series of simple artificial languages. The zero-order approximation is obtained by choosing all letters with the same probability and independently. The first-order approximation is obtained by choosing successive letters independently but each letter having the same probability that it has in the natural language. 5 Thus, in the first-order approximation to English, E is chosen with probability. 12 (its frequency in normal English) and W with probability .02, but there is no influence between adjacent letters and no tendency to form the preferred digrams such as TH, ED, etc. In the second-order approximation, digram structure is introduced. After a letter is chosen, the next one is chosen in accordance with the frequencies with which the various letters follow the first one. This requires a table of digram frequencies [...]. In the third-order approximation, trigram structure is introduced. Each letter is chosen with probabilities which depend on the preceding two letters.\"\n",
    "- Why does this work? Exactly because the transition probabilities converge, given that we have enough \"trials\", on a reasonable distribution, from which we can build a transition matrix\n",
    "- How do we measure the information of such a process? Shannon:\n",
    "> \"We have represented a discrete information source as a Markoff process. Can we define a quantity which will measure, in some sense, how much information is \"produced\" by such a process, or better, at what rate information\n",
    "is produced?\"\n",
    "- This measure is [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)!\n",
    "- Entropy is defined as $H = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_i \\log(\\frac{1}{p_i})$\n",
    "- It is based on the *uncertainty* of a fair coin flip: both outcomes are equally likely, the entropy is $0.5 \\log(\\frac{1}{0.5}) + 0.5 \\log(\\frac{1}{0.5}) = 0.5+0.5 = 1$. Generally, entropy is maximum where all outcomes are equally likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](6-nlp/shannon.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- This can again be illustrated by the average number of questions I need to ask to find a symbol\n",
    "- Suppose we have a machine (a \"discrete informations source represented as a Markov process\") that generates letters from the alphabet A,B,C, and D with $P=(0.5|0.25|0.125|0.125)$. To find the next letter I could ask \"Is it A?\". Because it is more likely that it actually *is* A, we are done in 50% of the time with just one question. If it is not A, then we can ask: \"Is it B?\", and we will be right 75% of the time (because we already excluded the possibility of it being A). Again, we build a decision tree, just with \"weights\", i.e. probabilities, attached to its branches, where the height of the decision tree represents the maximum number of questions we need to ask to find the next letter.\n",
    "- The total entropy of the source is the entropy of each state times the likelihood of that state.\n",
    "- Entropy has very important implications for compression. For instance, with [Huffman coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding) (lossless compression), the limit of compression is the entropy of the message source."

LSTMs and CLLMs are (super-easy and super-complicated, respectively) ways of accomplishing this. \n",

    "> And suddenly the memory returns. The taste was that of the little crumb of madeleine which on Sunday mornings at Combray (because on those mornings I did not go out before church-time), when I went to say good day to her in her bedroom, my aunt Leonie used to give me, dipping it first in her own cup of real or of lime-flower tea. The sight of the little madeleine had recalled nothing to my mind before I tasted it; perhaps because I had so often seen such things in the interval, without tasting them, on the trays in pastry-cooks' windows, that their image had dissociated itself from those Combray days to take its place among others more recent; perhaps because of those memories, so long abandoned and put out of mind, nothing now survived, everything was scattered; the forms of things, including that of the little scallop-shell of pastry, so richly sensual under its severe, religious folds, were either obliterated or had been so long dormant as to have lost the power of expansion which would have allowed them to resume their place in my consciousness. But when from a long-distant past nothing subsists, after the people are dead, after the things are broken and scattered, still, alone, more fragile, but with more vitality, more unsubstantial, more persistent, more faithful, the smell and taste of things remain poised a long time, like souls, ready to remind us, waiting and hoping for their moment, amid the ruins of all the rest; and bear unfaltering, in the tiny and almost impalpable drop of their essence, the vast structure of recollection.\n",
    "And once I had recognized the taste of the crumb of madeleine soaked in her decoction of lime-flowers which my aunt used to give me (although I did not yet know and must long postpone the discovery of why this memory made me so happy) immediately the old grey house upon the street, where her room was, rose up like the scenery of a theatre to attach itself to the little pavilion, opening on to the garden, which had been built out behind it for my parents (the isolated panel which until that moment had been all that I could see); and with the house the town, from morning to night and in all weathers, the Square where I was sent before luncheon, the streets along which I used to run errands, the country roads we took when it was fine. And just as the Japanese amuse themselves by filling a porcelain bowl with water and steeping in it little crumbs of paper which until then are without character or form, but, the moment they become wet, stretch themselves and bend, take on colour and distinctive shape, become flowers or houses or people, permanent and recognisable, so in that moment all the flowers in our garden and in M. Swann's park, and the water-lilies on the Vivonne and the good folk of the village and their little dwellings and the parish church and the whole of Combray and of its surroundings, taking their proper shapes and growing solid, sprang into being, town and gardens alike, from my cup of tea."
